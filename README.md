# Predictive Modeling and Factor Analysis on Student Dropout Using Machine Leaning Techniques

## ðŸ“š Introduction
This study explore the application of machine learning models in predicting student dropout tendencies. Utilizing a diverse dataset encompassing academic, demographic, and socio-economic factors, the study employs machine learning algorithms to automate predictions and provide insights into the factors influencing student retention.

## ðŸ’» Tools and Analysis
The dataset used in this study is sourced from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository and focuses on predicting students' dropout and academic success. It encompasses a wide array of information ranging from academic performance to socio-economic factors. Key variables include academic qualifications, curricular units, demographic details, and target labels indicating dropout, graduation, or enrollment status.

Programming languages such as Python were employed for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model development. Categorical features are re-mapped into new values, resulted in lower dimensionality of the data and better interpretation ([mapping dictionary here](https://github.com/hengkisan/azure-supermarket-datawarehouse)). Machine learning libraries such as Scikit-Learn and CatBoost were utilized for implementing classification algorithms like Random Forest and CatBoost.

## ðŸ’¡ Conclusion
The study concludes that Random Forest and CatBoost classifiers are effective in predicting student dropout rates. Balancing the dataset using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improved model accuracy and recall for dropout predictions.

Key findings include:
- Random Forest and CatBoost demonstrated comparable performance metrics, with precision values for dropout prediction ranging around 88% and recall around 78%.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that variables related to academic performance, such as curricular units and grades, significantly influenced dropout predictions.
- Interpretation using logistic regression highlighted the impact of categorical variables like financial status, gender, and parental qualifications on dropout rates.
